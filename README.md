Weather App — HTML, CSS & JavaScript

A simple and responsive Weather App that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can search any city to instantly view temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The project demonstrates API handling, DOM manipulation, and clean UI structuring using vanilla JavaScript.
